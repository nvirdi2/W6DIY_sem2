Reflection
This workshop lab was very interesting as I got to learn many new concepts. 
To start, there were many obstacles in the DIY that I encountered and I would say that
that was the hardest modules of this workshop to complete. However, defining copy constructors
and assignments were very easy, creating them in the module took a lot of work. I felt as
the creating was not to difficult, but not the easiest. To continue, I also learned a lot about
overload insertion and extraction operators so I could print using ostream or istream. This is a
topic I will definitely work on, as it did give me many issues along the way. This concept felt 
very new and it took a lot of time for me to process and understand what it is saying and doing. 
I believe the difficult part was more understanding the concept rather than applying it. Do not get
me wrong! Applying the concept was difficult too just not as much as understanding. I worked my way
around this situation by watching YouTube videos on it and looking at class code examples on the 
BTP 200 websites for more information. The simple file IO using ifstream and ofstream was easy to 
grasp, just it took a lot of effort to understand it at the start. The biggest issue I ran into 
while doing my DIY was carrying decimals. I have never had an issue with carrying decimals and this
was one of the issues I ran into that cause such a struggle to understand where it was. Turns out
I was using setprecision in the wrong area and it was not carrying it out to print.
